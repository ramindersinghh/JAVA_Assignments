/*
The HashMap class in Java implements the Serializable interface so that its objects can be written or serialized to a file using the ObjectOutputStream. However, the output file it produces is not in the human-readable format and may contain junk characters.

Serialization: It is a process of writing an Object into a file along with its attributes and content. It internally converts the object into a stream of bytes.

De-Serialization: It is a process of reading the Object and its properties from a file along with the Objectâ€™s content.

If we want to write a HashMap object to a plain text file, we need a simple and understandable code to write on the HashMap and then insert the Map into the Text File. We can write the code in the form of key-Value Pair of a map Object to a File and each line File will contain the Key-Value Pair
